# Asset-Class Routing Index — Which Pipeline for Which Asset

**Read this FIRST when a task says "model / create / make a new X."** It tells you WHICH of Far Horizon's
asset-creation routes applies to a given asset class, and points you at the one MANDATORY doc for that route.
It does NOT duplicate per-route content — each route's full rules live in its own doc (linked below); this is
the index above them.

Far Horizon has **four** distinct asset-creation routes. Picking the wrong one wastes a whole pass (a
procedural humanoid fights organic shapes; a Blender atlas-textured prop reads foreign beside faceted
geometry; a per-prop Blender model where procedural scatter would do is over-work). Route first, then go
read the route's MANDATORY doc before touching anything.

## The routing table

| Asset class | Route | MANDATORY doc | Reach for this when… / Don't use when… |
|---|---|---|---|
| **World / terrain / rocks / water / trees / scattered props** | **Procedural** — `LowPolyMeshes` / `FacetedRock` mesh-gen + URP Shader Graph (`LowPolyVertexColor` / `LowPolyWater`) | [`lowpoly-quality.md`](lowpoly-quality.md) (+ [`unity-conventions.md`](unity-conventions.md) §Asset creation) | **When:** the shape is generatable from code + seed (faceted rock, blob canopy, water plane, terrain, mass-scattered ground props) and benefits from per-instance seeded variation. **Don't when:** the shape is an organic humanoid, or a hero/held object whose silhouette is hand-authored (→ Character or Blender route). |
| **Weapons / tools / hero props** | **Blender / Blender-MCP** — faceted-chunky modeling, shared palette material (`weapon_palette.png` + one URP/Unlit mat), headless FBX export | [`blender-asset-pipeline.md`](blender-asset-pipeline.md) | **When:** a player-held or featured object whose silhouette is hand-authored (axe, knife, sword, spear, crafting table, campfire, chest) and must read crisp in-hand. **Don't when:** it's a mass-scattered background mesh (→ Procedural) or you're tempted to bake a per-asset texture atlas (BANNED — shared palette only). |
| **Characters** | **Hyper3D Rodin → Mixamo → Unity** — Image-to-3D mesh, auto-rig, **Generic** rig in Unity | [`character-pipeline.md`](character-pipeline.md) | **When:** a rigged/animatable humanoid or creature (the castaway, future NPCs/enemies). **Don't when:** it's a static prop (→ Blender/Procedural), or you reach for the Mixamo **Humanoid** rig under a scaled scene hierarchy (it explodes the mesh — use **Generic**). |
| **Action-verb animation** (animating an EXISTING rig, **not** creating geometry) | **Procedural additive-offset** — `CastawayArmPose` `LateUpdate` additive bone-rotation idiom; NO new Animator clip / state / layer / AvatarMask | [`procedural-animation-verbs.md`](procedural-animation-verbs.md) | **When:** authoring a verb (chop / pick-up / drink / throw) or any change to `CastawayArmPose` / `HeldAxeRig` / a held-prop seating driver. **Don't when:** you're creating new geometry or a new mesh (that's one of the three routes above) — this route only MOVES an existing rig. |

Each route's doc is a **MANDATORY pre-work read** for that route's tasks (per CLAUDE.md §Detailed Documentation
+ the "sub-agents Read every `.claude/docs/*.md` before work" rule). Read the route doc fully before starting —
this index is a routing slip, not a substitute for the route's rules.

## The decision rule when procedural fights the style

Mirrors `unity-conventions.md` §Asset creation ("**SOURCE a purpose-built base when the existing mesh fights
the target style**", `86ca8ca1m`):

> If **2+ mesh-edit / procedural attempts** at a style change fail, **STOP editing and switch routes** — source
> or author a base built in the target style rather than grinding more iterations against a route that fights
> the shape. Procedural is first-choice for generatable faceted geometry, but it fights organic humanoid shapes
> (→ Character route) and hand-authored hero silhouettes (→ Blender route). The whole point of having distinct
> routes is to switch instead of forcing one route to do another route's job.

(See `character-pipeline.md` for the same rule from the character side, and `blender-asset-pipeline.md` §3
for "source a purpose-built base" on the hero-prop side.)

## Cross-cutting rules that apply across ALL routes

These are NOT route-specific — they govern any asset regardless of how it was made (do not duplicate the
detail here; the cited doc owns it):

- **Shipped-build capture gate** — anything visually-visible needs evidence from the BUILT exe, not the editor
  (`unity-conventions.md` §Editor-vs-runtime; CLAUDE.md Hard rules). Editor-vs-runtime divergence is a proven
  failure class.
- **Committed-asset staleness** — bootstrap-generated `.unity`/`.mat`/`.asset` files are committed; a build ships
  the committed snapshot, so a fix in regen-code alone never reaches the build unless the asset is regenerated +
  committed ([[unity-procedural-committed-assets-go-stale]]).
- **Inverse of committed-asset staleness: a regen can run correctly and still ship corrupted committed data** if a
  local EditMode test mutates live global engine state (e.g. `RenderSettings.skybox`) without restoring it between
  the bake and the commit — CI self-heals (it always re-bakes before build/tests) so every mechanical gate stays
  green against generator-correct data while the COMMITTED snapshot is wrong; only a reviewer diffing committed
  values against the generator's source constants catches it. Full mechanism + fix: `unity-conventions.md`
  §Headless/CLI rituals (PR #231, ticket `86cahvntg`).
- **Material-honest + pattern-via-geometry** — a surface reads as its material (stone→flint, metal→steel; no
  arbitrary colors); surface pattern is modeled low-poly facets, NOT a detail-texture ([[weapon-asset-material-honest-pattern-via-geometry]]).
- **Single Unity build slot** — any route that ends in a Unity build is serialized to one at a time; fan out the
  non-build work (modeling, research, doc) in parallel ([[single-unity-build-slot-serializes-orchestration]]).
